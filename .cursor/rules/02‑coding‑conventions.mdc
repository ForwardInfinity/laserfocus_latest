# Styling, naming & quality gates

- Style‑guide: Prettier default, ESLint _eslint:recommended_ + `no‑implicit‑globals`.
- Naming: `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes, dash‑case for file names (`videoQueue.js`).
- Modules: Use ES Modules (`import …`) everywhere—even in tests.
- Logging: `console.log` is allowed only in tests; strip / guard in production code.
- Error handling: Use early returns, never swallow a caught `Error` silently.
- Tests:  
  - Every new source file must ship with a failing unit test first.  
  - Aim for ≥ 80 % branch coverage; CI fails below this threshold.
